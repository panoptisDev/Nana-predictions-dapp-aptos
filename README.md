## Introduction

Panana Predictions is a decentralized platform that enables users to **create their own markets** and **predict the future prices** of various assets. By offering a simple and engaging way for users to participate in prediction markets directly through **Telegram**, we aim to make decentralized finance **accessible to everyone**.

## Key Features

- **Telegram Bot Integration**: Interact with Panana Predictions directly within Telegram for ease of use.
- **Decentralized Prediction Markets**: Users can create their own markets and predict future asset prices.
- **Statistics and Historical Data**: A personalized performance dashboard allows users to track their past predictions and analyze historical data.
- **Automation**: A backend server responsible to ensure scheduled market creation and auto-resolving markets.
- **Trustless Pricefeed**: Used for fetching reliable asset price data on-chain via Switchboard oracles.

## Project Information

Panana Predictions was built from the ground up exclusively for the **Aptos Code Collision Hackathon**. Within the hackathon period, we developed the entire platform, including smart contracts, web application, and Telegram integration. Our goal is to continue developing Panana Predictions beyond the hackathon, expanding its features and user base.

- **Commits**: Over 100 commits
- **Lines of Code**: Over 10,000 lines of code

## Tech Stack

Panana Predictions leverages a modern and robust tech stack to provide a seamless user experience:

- **Aptos Move**: Provides the decentralized platform for our smart contracts.
- **Next.js**: A state-of-the-art React framework for building the web application.
- **React**: For building interactive user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring type safety and code reliability.
- **Bun**: Powers the backend server.
- **Switchboard Oracles**: Used for fetching reliable asset price data.
- **Telegram Bot API**: Integrates the platform into Telegram for easy user access.

Our marketplace and market move modules are designed for decentralized security, ensuring that all transactions are transparent and secure.

## Architecture Overview

Panana Predictions consists of three fundamental parts:

### 1. Marketplace and Market Move Modules

At the heart of Panana Predictions are the **Marketplace** and **Market Move Modules**.

- The **Marketplace Module** manages all markets for a specific asset (i.e. APT or BTC)
- The **Market Module** handles the interactions for placing bets, transferring assets, and distributing winnings based on market outcomes.
- All modules are designed in a way that allows an **easy extension** to add new Markets and asset types.
- **Switchboard Oracles** ensure a trusted and decentralized resolution of markets.

### 2. Telegram App & Web Application (Next.js)

To interact with the prediction markets, users access the platform via Telegram or the web. Built as a cutting-edge **Next.js** web application **optimzed for Telegram and the web**, the front-end provides a seamless and intuitive interface. All interactions and data fetching occur directly with the Aptos blockchain.


### 3. Server for Auto-Resolving Markets

The third component is a server that is responsible for **automatically resolving prediction markets** when they close. The server polls for new markets and is responsible for their resolution. This includes:

- **Resolution Scheduling**: The server schedules a new job to resolve the market at a specific time.
- **Market Resolution**: The server calls the Market module, which retrieves the final price data on-chain via a Switchboard Oracle and distributes the rewards.
- **Ensure Eventual Resolution:** By implementing a retry-mechanism in case the initial resolution failed, an eventual resolution is guaranteed.
